This repo is a fork of the [__Jumpstart Rails__][jumpstart] template, which is
like Laravel Spark, for Rails.

This fork replaces webpacker with [__Vite Rails__][vite_rails], and extends the
basic setup to include a working Stimulus example and Hotwire integration.

## Features ⚡️

- 💡 Instant server start
- ⚡️ Blazing fast hot reload
- 🚀 Stimulus + Turbo Hotwire
- 🛤 Path and API Helpers: [JS From Routes]
- [And more!][jumpstart]

It adds <kbd>[vite-plugin-stimulus-hmr]</kbd> for instant feedback on changes to
your Stimulus controllers, <kbd>[vite-plugin-full-reload]</kbd> to automatically
refresh the page when editing the Rails layout or templates, and __[JS From Routes]__
to automatically generate path and API helpers from the routes.

## Demo 🎥

Changes to Stimulus controllers don't require a full page refresh.

This feature is powered by <kbd>[vite-plugin-stimulus-hmr](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite-plugin-stimulus-hmr)</kbd>.

## Installation 💿

```bash
rails new myapp -d postgresql -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElMassimo/jumpstart-vite/master/template.rb
```

## Video Comparison 🎥

Webpacker on the left, Vite on the right. I run `foreman start`, wait until the page loads, then kill the process and run it a second time.

### Webpacker

Installing the vanilla Jumpstart template takes 5 minutes, be prepared to watch
`node-sass` spin for a while, along with all the webpack dependencies.

Once it's installed, and we have run `bin/rake db:create db:migrate`, we'll start it twice:

Cold start is particularly slow, and it locks Rails rendering.

### Vite ⚡️

Installing the Jumpstart template with Vite takes 1 minute.

Loads only 9 seconds after `foreman start`, and is also running a Stimulus example.

Subsequent loads are significantly faster.

## How does it work? 🤔

Vite is powered by [esbuild], which can process files [significantly faster] than Webpack.

Vite [does not bundle your code during development][no bundling], which means
as your app grows, the dev server will still start fast, and your changes will
continue be __updated instantly__.

In production, Vite [bundles your code][bundling] with tree-shaking, lazy-loading,
and common chunk splitting out of the box, to achieve optimal loading performance.
